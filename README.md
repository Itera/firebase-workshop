# Web development with Firebase Course
Welcome to our Firebase course ðŸ™Œ. This course will help you understand some of the basic functionality of Firebase and how to use it together with a web application to create awesome stuff!

## 1 prerequisites

### Node and npm:
This course requires that you have node installed. Please follow the next steps if you have not installed node before.
- âœ… Download the latest stable version from https://nodejs.org.
- âœ… To verify, write `node -v` in the console application. You should see a version number returned in your console application.
- âœ… To verify that npm is also installed, write `npm -v` in the console application.

### Yarn
TODO: Do we need Yarn installed?

### Git:
Another requirement for running this project is Git. Please follow the guide [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git if you have not already.

### Google account
In order to use your own Firebase project you need to have a Google account. 

## 2 Test that the web application starts

### Init the project:
- âœ… Direct yourself to the folder you want to include this project and then clone this project by typing `git clone <link to repo>` in your console application.
- âœ… After cloning this project, remember to `cd` into the project folder and run `yarn install` (Psst. `cd` stand for change directory and is the same as opening the folder in the finder app or directory on your mac/computer).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production, in this case to deploy to firebase, to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## 3 Course information
The goal of the course is to create a game using functionality in Firebase. We have created the application skeleton and it will be up to you to connect it together with Firebase. Of course with some proper task descriptions and assistance from us if needed. 

The game that will be created is "Cards Against Developers" a bit more friendly and developer specific version of Cards Against Humanity.

We have seperated the course into multiple parts, each part has its own Readme file under the tasks folder.

ðŸ‘‰ Tip: If you are stuck there is a seperate solutions folder. We reccomended trying or asking us before resorting to using the solution examples. 

**Part 1 goals:**
- Setup your own firebase project on Firebase console.
- Connect the application skeleton to Firebase. 

**Part 2 goals:**
- Learn how to work with Firestore.
- CRUD operations and realtime updates

**Part 3 goals:**
- Add authentication and secure your application. 

**Completed all the parts and eager for more? ðŸ’ª**
Extra work for those who needs additional challenges: 
- Frontend work
- Avoid duplicated cards
