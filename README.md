# Web development with Firebase Course
Welcome to our Firebase course ðŸ™Œ. This course will help you understand some of the basic functionality of Firebase and how to use it together with a web application to create awesome stuff!

## prerequisites

### Node and npm:
This course requires that you have node installed. Please follow the next steps if you have not installed node before.
- âœ… Download the latest stable version from https://nodejs.org.
- âœ… To verify, write `node -v` in the console application. You should see a version number returned in your console application.
- âœ… To verify that npm is also installed, write `npm -v` in the console application.

### Yarn
TODO: Do we need Yarn installed?

### Git:
Another requirement for running this project is Git. Please follow the guide [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git if you have not already.

### Google account
In order to use your own Firebase project you need to have a Google account. 

## Test that the web application starts

### Init the project:
- âœ… Direct yourself to the folder you want to include this project and then clone this project by typing `git clone <link to repo>` in your console application.
- âœ… After cloning this project, remember to `cd` into the project folder and run `yarn install` (Psst. `cd` stand for change directory and is the same as opening the folder in the finder app or directory on your mac/computer).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production, in this case to deploy to firebase, to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
